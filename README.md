# surfs_up

## Challenge Overview

This project helps explore the benefits of Advanced Data Storage & Retrieval, producing data analysis of tempature trends in Oahu & Hawaii. A summary statistics of temperature data were requested for the months of June and December, to determine if a prospective "Surf & Ice cream" shop could sustain & operate effectively year-round.

## Data Resources

- Data Source: hawaii.sqlite
- ipynb files: SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb, climate_analysis.ipynb
- Software: SQLlite, Python 3.9.2, Flask, Jupyter Notebook

## Challenge Results

- June & December temperature analysis showing the average temps for the two months.

### Key Differences in Weather: Oahu, Hawaii

- The average temperature in June is around 75 degrees, which is 4 degrees higher than the averave temp in Dec.
- The temperatures in June show to have much more normal distribution by the smaller std measured vs. Dec.
- Dec temps., are more viable than those in June given a larger range in recorded temps.
  - Looking at the plotted distribution of dec Temps, the median temp is Dec is more inline with the average, & with minimal outlires skuing the avg temp. 

## Summary

While the Temp vary to those in June, Dec would still have nice weather to sustain a Surf & Ice cream shop. With the average temp in June & Dec differ only by 4 degrees, looking at the Dec histogram, Dec medain temp is about 72 degrees.

With some additional analysis we can breakout Station vs Temps in both months to further solidify a final decision on whether or not to open up a Surf and Ice cream shop.

With the additional data analysis I would recommend moving forward with the decision to open up shop, enjoy a nice day of surfing and a scoop of ice cream.
